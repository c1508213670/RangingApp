# RangingApp
### The project is under the master path
A demo for learning communication\n
A ranging imaging app based on the playback function of dkplayer. The client receives the data from the radar and camera from the server and displays it on the client through TCP, UDP and RTSP protocols.
Similar to the car reversing radar, the straight-line distance from obstacles and the reversing picture can be obtained, but a steering gear is added to make the camera and radar rotate, so the angle data acquisition of the steering gear is added on the basis of image and distance. First, real-time radars and cameras transmit data to raspberry pie over a wireless network. The server program in raspberry pie reads the real-time data, and then uses socket to open the port, so that the server can establish a link with the client, so that the client can get the data. Since it is a ranging imaging app, it is necessary to display angle, distance and image at the same time. Due to the limitations of hardware and the conditions of data format, TCP, UDP and RTSP protocols are established respectively to receive data. Finally, each data is displayed through the constraintlayout layout, and the angle is dynamically displayed with the dial.
